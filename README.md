# enterprisereportcompare_analysis
The analysis_breakdown.py script is designed to analyze and break down the comparison results generated by the GIS Enterprise Reporter after running the compare.er tool. This script takes in the comparison output (e.g., an Excel file) and processes the data to help users easily identify key differences between two datasets.

The script categorizes the differences by severity (e.g., Warnings, Information) and provides detailed insights into what changed between the two compared datasets. It highlights discrepancies such as mismatches in aggregate values, record counts, and other important metrics.

Key Features:
Severe Differences Highlighted: It categorizes the differences into severity levels like Warning and Information, making it easier to focus on critical issues.
Detailed Comparison: The script provides the exact values from both datasets (RecordOne and RecordTwo), showing where the discrepancies occurred.
Summary of Differences: Each difference is calculated, allowing users to quickly see what changed, whether it's a difference in counts, total views, or byte sizes.
Usage:
Run the compare.er tool from the GIS Enterprise Reporter to generate a comparison report.
Provide the report file (usually an Excel file) to the script.
Run the script to process the results and output a structured breakdown of the differences.
Output Example:
The output will include the following information for each difference:

Difference Severity: Categorizes the issue as a warning, information, or other levels.
Difference Comment: Describes the nature of the difference, such as differing aggregate values or the same values.
Record One and Record Two: Shows the values from both datasets being compared.
Difference: Displays the numerical or categorical difference between the two records.
Sample Use Case:
You would use this script after running a comparison between two ArcGIS Enterprise systems, or different points in time for the same system, to help you spot discrepancies in data, usage statistics, or configuration.
