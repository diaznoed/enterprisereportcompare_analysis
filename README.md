# enterprisereportcompare_analysis
The analysis_breakdown.py script is designed to analyze and break down the comparison results generated by the GIS Enterprise Reporter after running the compare.er tool. This script takes in the comparison output (e.g., an Excel file) and processes the data to help users easily identify key differences between two datasets.
